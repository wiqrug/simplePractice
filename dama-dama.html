      <h3 id="titleOF">Fallow Deer</h3>
      <p class="description">
        The European fallow deer (Dama dama), also known as the common fallow
        deer or simply fallow deer, is a species of ruminant mammal belonging to
        the family Cervidae. It is historically native to Turkey and possibly
        the Italian Peninsula, Balkan Peninsula, and the island of Rhodes in
        Europe. Prehistorically native to and introduced into a larger portion
        of Europe, it has also been introduced to other regions in the world.
      </p>

      <h3 id="titleOF">Taxonomy</h3>
      <p class="description">
        Some taxonomists include the rarer Persian fallow deer as a subspecies
        (D. d. mesopotamica), with both species being grouped together as the
        fallow deer, while others treat it as a different species (D.
        mesopotamica).The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was once
        classified as Dama virginiana and the mule deer or black-tailed deer
        (Odocoileus hemionus) as Dama hemionus; they were given a separate genus
        in the 19th century.

            The male fallow deer is known as a buck, the female is a doe, and the
            young a fawn. Adult bucks are 140–160 cm (55–63 in) long, 85–95 cm
            (33–37 in) in shoulder height, and typically 60–100 kg (130–220 lb) in
            weight; does are 130–150 cm (51–59 in) long, 75–85 cm (30–33 in) in
            shoulder height, and 30–50 kg (66–110 lb) in weight. The largest bucks
            may measure 190 cm (75 in) long and weigh 150 kg (330 lb).[4] Fawns
            are born in spring around 30 cm (12 in) and weigh around 4.5 kg (10
            lb). Their lifespan is around 12–16 years.<br><br><br><br><br> Much variation occurs in
            the coat colour of the species, with four main variants: common,
            menil, melanistic, and leucistic – a genuine colour variety, not
            albinistic.[5] White is the lightest coloured, almost white; common
            and menil are darker, and melanistic is very dark, sometimes even
            black (and is easily confused with the sika deer).<br><br><br><br><br> Most herds consist
            of the common coat variation, yet animals of the menil coat variation
            are not rare. The melanistic coat variation is generally rarer, and
            the white coat variation is very much rarer still, although wild New
            Zealand herds often have a high melanistic percentage Only bucks have
            antlers, which are broad and shovel-shaped (palmate) from three years.
            In the first two years the antler is a single spike. They are grazing
            animals; their preferred habitat is mixed woodland and open grassland.
            During the rut bucks spread out and females move between them; at that
            time of year fallow deer are relatively ungrouped compared with the
            rest of the year, when they try to stay together in groups of up to
            150. Agile and fast in case of danger, fallow deer can run at a
            maximum speed of 50 km/h (30 mph)[8] over short distances. Being
            naturally less muscular than other cervids such as the roe deer, they
            are not as fast. Fallow deer can also jump up to 1.75 m (5 ft 9 in)
            high and up to 5 m (16 ft) in length.
